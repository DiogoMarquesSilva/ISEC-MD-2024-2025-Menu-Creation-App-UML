# ISEC - Modeling and Design (MD) - Menu Creation Application UML Project (2024/2025)

## Context

This repository contains the project materials developed for the practical assignment of the **Modeling and Design (MD)** course unit, part of the Computer Engineering degree at the Coimbra Institute of Engineering (ISEC), during the 2024/2025 academic year. The project involved the analysis and design of an information system for a **Menu Creation Application** aimed at optimizing family meal management.

## Project Goal

The primary objective was to apply **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** principles and **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** diagrams to model a software solution across three distinct development phases: Vision & Scope, Problem Analysis, and Solution Design.

## Project Phases & Key Aspects Covered

The project was structured into three cumulative phases:

1.  **Phase 1 - Vision and Scope:**
    * Defining the system's context, boundaries, users (Family, External System, Affiliated Companies), and stakeholders (External Calendar Systems).
    * Identifying high-level functionalities and system interfaces.
    * Creating the initial **Use Case Diagram** and brief Use Case descriptions for at least 10 non-trivial scenarios (e.g., Create/Manage Menus, Manage Food List, Manage Shopping List, Configure Reminders, Export Agenda).
    * Specifying supplementary requirements (non-functional, organizational, external).

2.  **Phase 2 - Problem Analysis:**
    * Detailed specification of selected Use Cases (e.g., Manage Agenda, Configure Reminders, Export Agenda), including main scenarios and alternative flows.
    * Development of **Activity Diagrams** to visualize Use Case workflows.
    * Creation of the **Domain Model** (conceptual class diagram) representing key entities and relationships.
    * Elaboration of a **Glossary** defining relevant terms.

3.  **Phase 3 - Solution Design:**
    * Creation of the **System Sequence Diagram (SSD)** for the selected Use Case(s) from Phase 2.
    * Detailed design for two significant system operations identified in the SSD, including:
        * Low-level **Class Diagrams** incorporating design patterns and principles (e.g., Controller, separation of concerns).
        * Low-level **Sequence Diagrams** illustrating object interactions.
    * Refinement of the **Glossary** to include design-level details (messages, parameters).

## Tools Used

* UML Modeling Tools: StarUML
